### 🌸 About Me

```
💻 By day: IT Technician solving tech mysteries
🌙 By night: Self-taught coder debugging life one error message at a time
📊 Currently diving into: Data Analytics & Business Intelligence
🎯 Mission: Turning IT support experience into data-driven superpowers
```

I'm that girl who went from "turning it off and on again" to actually understanding *why* it works. Currently on a self-teaching journey, transforming my IT support background into coding skills—because why just fix problems when you can build solutions? 

Right now, I'm exploring the fascinating intersection of **Data Analytics** and **Business Intelligence**, with a special focus on Workday BI. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood support tech who decided that spreadsheets and dashboards looked way too interesting to ignore.
